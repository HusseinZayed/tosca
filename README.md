CRSX
====
CRSX is a functional programming language design to facilitate writing compilers and other syntax-directed transformation systems. 

Its main features are:

* special notations for using embedded syntax, even higher order abstract syntax,
* special support for symbol tables, environments, and attributes, as used in compilers,
* an inclusion polymorphic sort system  
* a fast runtime: CRSX systems are compiled directly to native code for effective execution.

Under the cover, CRSX implements an extended higher-order rewriting formalism.
