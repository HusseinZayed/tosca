\textbf{Abstract.} 
%
We present \Tosca, a compiler generator \emph{and} 
a programming language. 
%
\Tosca leaves only a small footprint and we have designed it striving
for a light-weight architecture that reduces compiler construction to
high-level code generation---%
rather than relying on a full compilation stack.
%
Given as input the syntax of a source language \PL together with its
semantics, the \Tosca compiler generator generates the source code for
a compiler of \PL---currently in \java~8.  After employing an
off-the-shelf \java compiler, one obtains an executable compiler for
\PL.
%
The \Tosca language, the implementation language of
\Tosca, is a rule-based, higher-order, lazy functional language
that has its roots in higher-order rewriting, more precisely
Combinatory Reduction Systems.
%
We successfully used the \Tosca compiler generator to generate a 
compiler for the \Tosca language.
