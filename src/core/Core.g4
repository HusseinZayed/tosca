%MS: Why is there a separation between form and sort?
     Theory 1: 'LCURLY csortkv+ RCURLY' should not be allowed at root. 
               However, this is already guaranteed by the data sort declaration.
               So currently, for data declaration is
                 allowed:     DATA C1(C2({C3 : #X}))
                 not allowed: DATA C1({C3 : #X})
               Is this intended?
     Theory 3: 'LCURLY csortkv+ RCURLY' should not be allowed at all.
               But currently it is, so there is something wrong.
     Theory 2: There is no real difference (any more) and 
               the form-productions should be dropped.

 %MS: About the distinction between 'cterm' and 'cbound'.
      We argue for dropping this distinction here. 
      That is, drop the productions: 
        'cbounds', 'cbound', 'cbinder'
      and add the following to 'cterm'
        ' | VARIABLE<binder=x> csort? cbinders<binds=x> cterm '
      
 
     Argument: A 'cbound' is (semantically) a 'cterm'. 
     
     When coding, I realized, that it is much more convient for functions like 
     "IsLinear", "IsVariable", "Unify", and for recursive definitions
     to work with 'cterm' only.
 
     The distinction is currently used at:

     * 'RULE  cterm ARROW cterm'
       So we want to prevent rules like 
         x y . #F(x,y) â†’ x y . #F(y,x) 

       If we want to do that, we should do it here 
        'RULE cterm ARROW cterm', so e.g., 'RULE pattern ARROW cterm'
       and not at 'cterm' level.

       There are several more conditions on the rules, which are not
       expressible with the grammar 
       (e.g., in the left hand side each meta variable 
              has only distinct bound variables as arguments) 
       and some who are 
       (e.g., the left hand side is not only a meta variable)
 
       We should discuss, which we want to encode in the grammar, if any.

      * 'METAVAR LPAR cterms RPAR'
        Currently this is
          not allowed: #F(x.C(x))    
          allowed:     #F(S(x.C(x))) 
        We guess, the reason lies with second order, i.e.,
        a meta variable which takes as argument a function is not allowed.
        i.e., it is not allowed that #F is of sort '(Sort1 -> Sort2) -> Sort3' 
        
        However, this is not preventable with the grammar. If in the allowed case 
         #F(S(x.C(x))) the 'S' is actually the Idendity function, then we 
        easily rewrite to the not allowed #F(x.C(x)).

        Hence it is not possible to enforce this condition through the grammar. 
       
       * 'csortkv : cconstructor COLON cterm'
         see comment in 'csortkv'

       * 'ckv : METAVAR COLON cterm  
              | VARIABLE COLON cterm
              | STRING COLON cterm'
          Here, it depends on the sematic, which terms should be allowed here.
          But we feel like it could be better to again define the restrictions here,
          and not on the 'cterm'?
